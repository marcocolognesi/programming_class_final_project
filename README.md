**Suicide is a serious global public health issue**. It is among the **top twenty leading causes of death worldwide**, with more deaths due to suicide than to malaria, breast cancer, or war and homicide. 
Close to 800 000 people die by suicide every year (***World Health Organization, 2019***).
\n 
The aim of this project is to **analyze** and **visualize** the different suicide rates around the world and how they changed over the years (***from 1985 to 2020***), and also to see the **correlation** between our data. In particular, we are interested to know if the GDP per capita is a factor that influences the rates.
\n In the last steps of our analysis we are gonna implement some basic **Machine Learning** examples such as **clustering** and **linear regression**.
